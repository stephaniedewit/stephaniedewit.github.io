Gitbook used to create this GitHub Pages: https://github.com/stephaniedewit/portfolio_book

This repository contains the HTMLs for a GitHub Pages website, which showcases a portfolio with skills I gained during the _Data Sciences for Biology_ minor at Hogeschool Utrecht, The Netherlands. This GitHub Pages is my final product for the DSFB2 Workflows course.
