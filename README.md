This repository contains the HTMLs for a [GitHub Pages
website](https://stephaniedewit.github.io), which showcases a portfolio
with skills I gained during the *Data Sciences for Biology* minor at
Hogeschool Utrecht, The Netherlands. This GitHub Pages is my final
product for the DSFB2 Workflows course.
