This repository contains the HTMLs for a [GitHub Pages website](https://stephaniedewit.github.io), which showcases a portfolio with skills I gained during the _Data Sciences for Biology_ minor at Hogeschool Utrecht, The Netherlands. This GitHub Pages is my final product for the DSFB2 Workflows course.
